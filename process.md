## Author Submission

### Prepare manuscript {#sec-prepare}

::: {.callout-tip}
**We strongly recommend the following workflow for authors.**
:::

- Create a new repo in **your** GitHub account using the template repository: [`jsds-sports/jsdss-manuscript-template`](https://github.com/jsds-sports/jsdss-manuscript-template).
    - Go to: <https://github.com/jsds-sports/jsdss-manuscript-template>
    - Click **Use This Template** in the upper right.
    - Toggle **Include All Branches** so that it is ON.
    - Give the repo a reasonable name of your choice.
    - You may choose to change the visibility to **Private** while working on the project.
    - Click **Create Repo**.
- Clone repo to your machine.
- Write paper with code and data. Use the Quarto template for the paper.
- Include a URL for the repo in the Acknowledgement section, or add editor as a collaborator to repo
- Generate PDF

::: {.callout-warning}

Alternatively, authors can choose to submit a PDF created in another manner. However, note that using [our template](https://github.com/jsds-sports/jsdss-manuscript-template) will eventually be required before publication if your manuscript proceeds along the review process and into the [GitHub review stage](#sec-github). 

:::

### Submit PDF

- Submit PDF to the [OJS system at Charlotte](https://journals.charlotte.edu/)

## *JSDSS* Initial Review Process

### Editor review

- An Editor will read the paper and determine if it is appropriate for *JSDSS*. 
    - If the paper not appropriate, it will be **rejected** without further review. 
    - If the paper is appropriate, the Editor will assign an Associate Editor to handle the review.

### Associate Editor (AE) review

- An [Associate Editor](link to editorial board) will read the paper and determine if it merits a full review *JSDSS*. 
    - If the paper does not merit a full review, it will be **rejected** without further review. 
    - If the paper does merit a full review, the AE will assign **at least two** peer reviewers to read the PDF and submit their feedback in writing.
- The AE will combine the reviewers' feedback and their own and come to *exactly one* of the following recommendations:
    - **Reject**: The paper does not have a viable path to publication in *JSDSS*.
    - **Revise and resubmit**: The AE sees a path to publication, but the paper has substantive shortcomings that need to be addressed before any potential GitHub Review Process is initiated. 
    - **Invite to [GitHub Review Process](#sec-github-init)**: The AE sees a path to publication and wishes to initiate a deeper review. 
- The Editor will make a decision based on the AE's recommendation. 

::: {.callout-caution}

An invitation to the GitHub Review Process is **not** a conditional acceptance. 

:::

### Author decision

- Based on the Editor's decision and the AE and reviewer feedback, the author may choose to continue the review process, or withdraw the paper. 
- A decision of **Revise and resubmit** could occur more than once. 
- A decision of **Reject** or **Invite to GitHub Review Process** is terminal. 


## Initiation of GitHub Review {#sec-github-init}

- The author is responsible for creating a GitHub repository and putting the paper contents in *JSDSS* Quarto format, as described in @sec-prepare. 

::: {.callout-note title="Brian"}
(ZZZ add pro tips, like `pandoc` code. We should try this first.)
:::

- The GitHub Actions script that is already part of the template needs to execute correctly. This will be executed automatically when the author pushes changes to the repo on GitHub.
- Upon successful rendering via GitHub Actions in the **author's** repo, the AE **forks** the author's repo into the `jsds-sports` GitHub Organization.
    - At this point, the author should create a [**release**](https://docs.github.com/en/repositories/releasing-projects-on-github/about-releases) at the time the repo is forked.
    - After it is forked, the author also makes the repo public (perhaps temporarily), to give the AE the "Change Visibility" permissions when the article is ready to be published. The AE won't change Private to Public until final publication. 
    - If the author doesn't want the repo to be public yet, they can immediately Change Visibility to Private again. Otherwise, the author can leave it as Public.
    - AE goes to Settings page
        - General
            - Check that Change Visibility permissions are available. Otherwise, asks author to do the previous step.
            - Rename the repo to match the OJS paper ID tracking system (e.g., `2026-baumer-413`).
            - Enable Issues 
        - Rules, rulesets
            - Create Protect Main Branch rule (ZZZ can we create a org-wide template?)
                - New branch ruleset
                - Default branch (main)
                - Click Require a pull request before merging
        - Pages
            - In the branch section, chooses `gh-pages`. 
        - Actions
            - Select **Quarto Publish** on the left, and select **Run Workflow** on the right to confirm GitHub Actions has no problems. (It automatically runs if public, but not if private.)
        - Collaborators and Teams
            -  Invite Authors as collaborators with direct access and **Write** permissions 
    - AE goes to main repo page and creates an `R0` release in the forked repo.

## *JSDSS* GitHub Review Process {#sec-github}

### Review phase {#sec-review}

- The GitHub Actions script that is already part of the template needs to execute correctly.
- **Main comments:** AE collates comments from reviewers posted in OJS and creates [GitHub Issues](https://docs.github.com/en/issues/tracking-your-work-with-issues/learning-about-issues/about-issues) for more substantive feedback.
    - One Issue per main comment (could be from multiple reviewers).
    - One Issue for all typos and minor suggestions.
    - AE assigns Issues to the author, reviewer(s) that gave feedback related to that Issue, and themselves.
- **Minor edits:** At any time throughout this process, the AE (and other reviewers) can send simple, non-controversial minor edits back to the author via a pull request from `jsds-sports/2026.baumer.736 reviewer1-edits` to `jsds-sports/2026.baumer.736 main` (using the suggestions feature) and adding the author as the reviewer.

### Revision Phase {#sec-revise}

- Author will respond to GitHub Issues (can ask clarifications, push back, etc.) by comment via the web interface.
- Author edits the original repo on their account.
    - Commits should be tagged to Issues.
- For each Issue, the author
    - Creates a new branch on the JSDSS repo `jsds-sports/2026-baumer-413` to address that Issue, and makes edits on that branch.
    - Creates a pull request from the branch to `jsds-sports/2026-baumer-413 main` and can send commits to this branch as they see fit (may need to **Change Base**)
    - Ensures that all feedback from the Issue are addressed in the pull request.    
    - Tags the AE and corresponding reviewers to review the pull request. 
- The author repeats for each Issue. If there are 5 Issues there will be 5 brances and 5 pull requests. 

::: {.callout-note title="Brian"}
(ZZZ maybe move down? See first comment in #3) 
:::
::: {.callout-note title="Ben"}
I'm not sure that one-to-one correspondence is necessary/optimal. Small sets of issues could be in the same pull request, no? 
:::

- If the GitHub Actions script works, and the AE is satisfied, AE merges the pull request and creates an `R1` release.

### Review and revise phase iteration

- AE makes *exactly one* of the follwing recommendations to Editor:
    - **Reject**: The paper has fatal flaws that prevent publication in *JSDSS*
    - **Revise and resubmit**: Continue the review process
    - **Accept**: The paper is ready for publication
- The Editor will make a decision based on the AE’s recommendation.
- The review (@sec-review) and revision (@sec-revise) phases may be repeated until the Editor is satisfied.

## Production Phase

- Author signs copyright forms.
- Editor obtains a DOI for the paper.
- Editor adds watermark and logo to the paper for authenticity.
- Editor creates a `final` release and the repo is frozen.
- GitHub Pages is turned **ON** and the paper is available in HTML/PDF/Word formats at `https://jsds-sports.github.io/2026-baumer-413/`.
- Editor adds that URL and paper metadata to the `jsds-sports.github.io` main website.
- Editor adds PDF of the paper to Project Euclid.  
- Paper is now available via Project Euclid and the GitHub Pages site.
